 Write a program to determine if a user can access a special event based on their
 age and geographic location. The event is only for individuals aged 18 to 35 who
 live in "City A", "City B", or "City C".

 User inputs:
   Age (int): Number representing the user's age.
   City (str): Name of the city where the user lives.

 Expected output:
   Access (str): Message indicating whether or not the user has access to the event.
