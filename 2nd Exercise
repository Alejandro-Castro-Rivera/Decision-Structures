 Write a program that requests a score between 0 and 100. If the score is outside
 this range, display an error message "Error: score must be between 0 and 100". 
 If the score is within the correct range, display the grade using the following table:

 Score      Grade
 >= 90      Outstanding
 >= 80      Notable
 >= 70      Good
 >= 60      Sufficient
 < 60       Insufficient

 User inputs:
   Score (float): The score entered by the user, expected to be between 0 and 100.

 Expected output:
   Grade (str): The corresponding grade based on the score entered.
