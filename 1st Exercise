When a worker exceeds 40 hours worked in a week they need to be paid overtime at 1.5 times their hourly rate

 User inputs:
   Hours worked (int ): The number of hours the employee has worked during the week.
   Hourly rate (float): The pay rate the employee receives under normal conditions.

 Expected output:
   Salary (float): Total pay due to the employee, including the extra charge for overtime
 
Use the round() function to round to two decimal places.
